# AUTHOR's NOTE ABOUT ARCHIVAL

Hi there. I'm going to keep things raw here somewhat.

I must move on from this project. I will be becoming an adult soon, and this means many things.
Through using Python, I have found that I have been much too babied by it's many utilities that it offers.
I am not saying that Python is too easy, but that in order to grow I have to get away from EVERYTHING about Python and these other interpreted and scripting languages. They will not just be trashed, I will have to compartmentalize their usage into certain avenues. I cannot use Python as my main "programming language" any longer. I desperately NEED to get into the more difficult things. There is SO MUCH that I don't know, and it pains me to look up at those stars and extend my arm only to realize my hand is only covering them, I have not yet even grasped them.
I am SO FAR from achieving what I originally set out to when I started programming.
To give you an idea, I started programming in September of 2021 because of my High School computer science course. 
I am now no longer in that class, and today it is the 31st of May, 2022.
I would like to clarify that that class only got me as far as "if" statements, after that I took the initiative, it was TOO SLOW to wait for them to teach me anything. To give you an idea, by the end of the year, that class never went over even the CONCEPT of a "class" in Python. 
A sidenote as well is that the project & repository "hagia" on this GitHub profile was born out of a frustration at the UTTER TRASH that was the graphics library they forced us into inside a web environment inside the browser.
ABSOLUTELY SUFFOCATING. Computer Science in education has only put a bad taste in my mouth in that fact that it is UNEFFECTIVE.
I don't know how college will be, but I'm also skeptical about that.

I got a bit sidetracked there, huh?

It might be difficult just to throw away all this progress I have made with Python, but I cannot allow this gigantic piece of software that all of my projects have been sitting on top of to obscure the important details that I must know for what I want to do in the coming years.

I HATE my reliance on Python.
I know that throwing it away means a lot of pain to learn something new, but it must be done.

Thank you EVERYBODY who is here and has even taken a SINGLE GLANCE at any of my projects.
And an even greater appreciation to my friends who rooted for me in the library at school on the school computers while I was still struggling to even create the project that now resides in the "hagia" repository on this profile.

I love you all, and I want you to make the best of what you have.
Even if you have messed up SO BAD, there is still SO MUCH you can do.
Judging by my own age, I'd ASSUME that most of us here have a GREAT MANY YEARS left in us.

So if you are using this downloader, please stop.
I know what it's like for that stuff (and you know what I'm talking about), to have a hold on you.
Think of it like the Dark Hold from that Dr. Strange movie. It's literally just like that, except it doesn't make you powerful.
THROW IT AWAY. TRASH THE R18 STUFF. UNCHAIN YOURSELF FROM THAT HELL, *OKAY?!*

That's all. Once more, I love you all.
**Farewell** for now, as I cannot be sure when I will produce a somewhat OK project.
I won't give up, and whatever it is that you are chasing, you BETTER NOT EITHER.

**<3** *~* star *(0xSTAR)*

And for reasons if people do continue to use NH-DL...
