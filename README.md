# NH-DL

NH-DL is (preferably) a GUI utility for downloading from a very special website.
Speaking of this website, this is the perfect time for a...

## DISCLAIMER

This tool, that is, NH-DL, is intended for use by adults who are willingly submitting
themself to the possibility that they could potentially view adult (R18) content.

# CONTINUED...

NH-DL is (preferably) a GUI, as well as a command-line downloading utility that offers 
the ability to download from the website NHentai without an account, and with relative ease
by simply typing in the "sauce code" (a 6-digit code, uniquely identifying a work), and 
pressing the "DL" (Download) button.

# CURRENT STATUS AND GETTING NH-DL

NH-DL is currently in it's early stages, however it is not far from finished.
If you would like to try out NH-DL, grab the latest beta release from the
"Releases" tab.

If you are on Windows, I recommend that you grab the "NH_gui-win64.zip" for the GUI
or "NH-cli.exe" if the command-line is what you're into.

If you are on Linux and using X11, grab the "NH_gui-linux64.zip" for the GUI,
and if you want something that isn't a GUI, and doesn't require X11, grab "NH-cli".

## USING NH-DL

Here is how to use the NH-DL variants.

### GUI

Type the 6-digit "sauce code" into the box that says so, and press "DL".
Watch the progress bar fill up to 100% and when it's finished it should
be in the save directory indicated in the GUI.

You can also change this save directory by clicking "- CHANGE DIRECTORY -".
(which is recommended)

### CLI

NOTE: The GUI executable can also be used as a command-line utility exactly as shown below

Run the executable

```
NH-cli
```

Along with the sauce code as the argument

```
NH-cli 337171
```

Wait... and enjoy!
